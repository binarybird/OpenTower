Tower construction and maintenance simulator!    
    
A simple clone of SimTower - a tower construction and simulation game.    
    
There was a project to reboot this game, but it looks like it went nowhere; it seemed too ambitious, with 3d modelling and all.    
This project will be a faithful 2D clone of the original game (with some modern enhancements of course).   
     
The core of the game will be using the Cocos-2DX C++ engine. This will enable the game to be platform agnostic and with some work, mobile device compatible.    
    
The platforms I am currently putting my efforts in to are Mac and Windows (linux should be easy though). Iphone/WindowsPhone/Android much, much later

Notes for casual users: You can run and build what I have here, but a stable "normal" program for release is still in the works!
