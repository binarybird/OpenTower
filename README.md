Tower construction and maintenance simulator!    
    
A simple clone of SimTower - a tower construction and simulation game.    
    
---------------------------------------------------------------        
What makes this project special?    
    
The OpenTower structure/sim logic is abstracted and COMPLETELY separate from the GUI and rendering logic. You can implement a SimTower clone using any gaming engine you want (this also makes the OpenTower runnable on pretty much anything). You could even make an ascii version for a command line SimTower clone!    
    
For my purposes, I used the cocos2d-x C++ engine for rendering junk.   
         
The platforms I am currently putting my efforts in to are Mac and Windows (linux should be easy though).
    
If youd like to contribute, just ping me!

Progress:    

Theres a menu, you can open a new tower (saving almost implemented)
In game - you can build an office, but thats it for now :p

Notes for casual users: You can run and build what I have here, but a stable "normal" program for release is still in the works!    

Basic Class Diagram (Im not one much for documentation, sorry :p )    
    
I dont have my Cocos2D-X implementation documented yet - its late, ill do it later.
